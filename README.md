# Assignment-3-Sudoku
In this assignment you are to implement a program to solve Sudoku Puzzles.
A Sudoku puzzle is a nine by nine grid (9x9) where each square can contain a number 19. Further, in every row, in every column, and in every box, the numbers 19 must uniquely occur (and thus cannot be repeated).
